# Bin Packing (MIPS)
This repository contains a solution to the **Bin Packing Problem** using MIPS assembly language. The goal is to find the **minimum number of unit-sized bins** required to pack items of floating-point sizes between 0 and 1 using two heuristics:

- **First Fit (FF)**
- **Best Fit (BF)**

## Project Description

Given a list of items with sizes between 0 and 1, this program implements:

- **First Fit (FF)**: Places each item in the first bin that has enough space.
- **Best Fit (BF)**: Places each item in the fullest bin that can still accommodate it.
